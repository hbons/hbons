# Hello! I'm Hylke, a product designer who codes.

I was recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/13/microsoft-layoffs">laid off</a> and I'd love to be able to create **_apps for Linux_** and contribute **_design for FOSS projects_**. I hope to gather enough monthly sponsors to **_sustain a minimum wage_**, so I can do this full-time. 

Current goals:
- Rewrite <a href="https://github.com/hbons/SparkleShare" target="_blank">SparkleShare</a> from C# to 🦀 <a href="https://github.com/hbons/Twinkle" target="_blank">Rust</a>
- Polish  ✨ <a href="https://github.com/hbons/Bobby" target="_blank">Bobby</a> and submit it to GNOME Circle
- Start an initiative so FOSS-projects can get ✏️ **_free design support_** from me

Even $1 a month helps.

Thank you!
